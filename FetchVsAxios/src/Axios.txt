AXIOS 

npm install axios

Axios is a javascript library for making HTTP Request from Noe.js or XMLHttpREQUESTs OR Browser.
It's Based on Promise API.

SYNTAX:

axios.get(url)
	.then(response => console.log(response))
	.catch((error) => console.log(error))

AXIOS CONFIG OBJECT:

BASEURL
PARAMS
HEADERS
AUTH
RESPONSETYPE

AXIOS RESPONSE OBJECT:

DATA		-	Actually Response Body
STATUS 		-	HTTP Status of the call like 202 or 404
STATUSTEXT	-	HTTP Status as a text message 
HEADERS		-	The same as in Request
CONFIG		-	Request Configuration
REQUEST 	-	XMLHTTPREQUEST OBJECT


axios.POST({
	'/url',
	{name: 'Harry', age: 22},
	{ options }
})

OR

const config = {
	url: 'http//api.com',
	method: 'POST',
	header: {
		'Content-Type': 'application/json'
	},
	data: {name: 'Harry', age: 22}
}
axios(config);


In axios we pass data in  the request OR Get data from the response and it's automatically stringified. 
(No Other options Required)


axios.get(url)
	.then(response => console.log(response))
	.catch((error) => {f
		if(error.response) {
			// when response status code is out of 2xx range 
			console.log(error.response.data)
			console.log(error.response.status)
			console.log(error.response.headers)
		}
		else if (error.request) {
			// when no response was recieved after request was made
			console.log(error.request)
		}
		else {
			//Error
			console.log(error.message)
		}
	})

Axios HTTP Interception is the one of the key features of this ibrarry, that's why we don't have to create additional code to use it. 

 //	request interceptor
 axios.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
 	console.log('Request sent')
 })

 //	response interceptor
 axios.interceptors.request.use((response) => {
 	// do an operation on response
 	return response
 })

axios.get(url)
	.then(response => console.log(response))
	.catch((error) => console.log(error))



DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FETCH & AXIOS :

fetch's body = Axios's data
fetch's body has to be stringified, axios's data contqins the object.
fetch has no url in request objbject, axios has url in request object.
fetch request function includes the url as parameter , axios request function doesn't includes url as parameter.
